### Installing
* 1: Clone The Repo
* 2: Run it on your terminal
* 3: Answer the questions given

## What I Learned
* How to use the tensorflow libaray to train the AI and based on data and take that data to classify a image
* How to use Numpy to turn data into an array and make it easier for the AI to class the image
* How to use skimage to resize a image 
* pyplot to show a image
